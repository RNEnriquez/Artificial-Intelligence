    "# Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n",
    "---\n",
    "Constraint satisfaction is a general problem solving technique for solving a class of combinatorial optimization problems by imposing limits on the values in the solution. The goal of this exercise is to practice formulating some classical example problems as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), and then to explore using a powerful open source constraint satisfaction tool called [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) from Microsoft Research to solve them. Practicing with these simple problems will help you to recognize real-world problems that can be posed as CSPs; some solvers even have specialized utilities for specific types of problem (vehicle routing, planning, scheduling, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of CSP solvers available for CSPs. Z3 is a \"Satisfiability Modulo Theories\" (SMT) solver, which means that unlike the backtracking and variable assignment heuristics discussed in lecture, Z3 first converts CSPs to satisfiability problems then uses a [boolean satisfiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) (SAT) solver to determine feasibility. Z3 includes a number of efficient solver algorithms primarily developed to perform formal program verification, but it can also be used on general CSPs. Google's [OR tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/) includes a CSP solver using backtracking with specialized subroutines for some common CP domains.\n",

    "We'll start by exploring the Z3 module with a _very_ simple & classic CSP problem called cryptarithmetic. A cryptarithmetic puzzle is posed as an arithmetic equation made up of words where each letter represents a distinct digit in the range (0-9). (This problem has no practical significance in AI, but it is a useful illustration of the basic ideas of CSPs.) For example, consider the problem and one possible solution shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  T W O  :    9 3 8\n",
    "+ T W O  :  + 9 3 8\n",
    "-------  :  -------\n",
    "F O U R  :  1 8 7 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are six distinct variables (F, O, R, T, U, W), and when we require each letter to represent a disctinct number (e.g., F != O, R != T, ..., etc.) and disallow leading zeros (i.e., T != 0 and F != 0) then one possible solution is (F=1, O=8, R=6, T=9, U=7, W=3). \n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPLEMENTATION: Declaring Variables\n",
    "For this problem we need a single variable for each distinct letter in the puzzle, and each variable will have an integer values between 0-9. (We will handle restricting the leading digits separately.) Complete the declarations in the next cell to create all of the remaining variables and constraint them to the range 0-9."
